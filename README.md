# Urkdash Arduino Library Examples Repository

The repository contains example Arduino sketches that demonstrate the use of the Urkdash library. These sketches are organized into three folders:

- **basic**: This folder contains basic examples that demonstrate the use of the Urkdash library for basic functionality such as sending sensor data and controlling actuators.

- **over the air (OTA)**: This folder contains examples that demonstrate how to use the Urkdash library for over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates. This is a useful feature for remotely updating the firmware on your devices without having to physically connect to them.

- **WiFi Manager**: This folder contains examples that demonstrate how to use the Urkdash library for managing WiFi connections. This is useful for configuring your devices to connect to different WiFi networks based on their location.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the Urkdash Arduino library, you will need to have the following:

- An Urkdash account
- An Arduino board with WiFi connectivity
- The Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO) installed on your computer

Once you have these prerequisites, you can download the Urkdash library from the Arduino Library Manager or manually install it by downloading the ZIP file from this repository and importing it into your Arduino IDE.

To use the examples provided in this repository, simply open the relevant sketch in the Arduino IDE, modify the variables to match your Urkdash account credentials, and upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
